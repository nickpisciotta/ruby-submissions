## Gif of Game Flow

### GOAL 1: Smooth out the color filling animation - doesn't have to be your end goal - just traveling

  * While the gif above is a little choppy we've definitely been able to smooth out our color filling animation and make it travel.
  * There are a few more bugs here we would like to work on, and if we can, we'd like to make it a little prettier and more user friendly
  * I don't believe we deviated at all from the plans for this task
  * Any recommendations on additional "fun" animations?

### GOAL 2: Handle logic for boards that involve multiple segments

  * Woo! We did it. This feels like one of the major pieces of our game. We were able to Handle logic for a board that involves multiple segments as expected.
  * This piece of logic works currently for vertical and horizontal lines, they can intersect anywhere and it will still work.
  * We did not deviate from our instructions as expected.
  * I currently don't have questions about this piece of the application

### GOAL 3: Move through 2 to 3 levels

  * We actually managed to have 4 levels! And can easily add more.
  * We have a very basic game flow that we intend to style and clean up in our next steps
  * The screenshot above shows the movement through the first four levels

### Stretch Goal: Make the play through on levels friendly - visual indicators around what's happening - some design around a wrapper for the game

  * We do have a basic play through and visual indicators around what's happening. There is some very basic styling and design.

## Next Steps?
  * Our next steps are styling and improving game flow so that it is more pleasant for the user
  * There is also some major refactoring that needs to be done
  * We would like to have at least 10 game boards

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  * None that I can think of at the moment!

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

These goals should center around wrapping up the game:

 - Matching the [rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown) requirements
 - Refactoring/Cleaning up test coverage
 - Making the game compelling for players
 - Making sure the README and other documentation is up to snuff
 - Making sure the game is deployed

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_
