# Game Time Check In # 3

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1
  - [Link to commit with goal accomplished](https://github.com/nickpisciotta/game-time/blob/master/lib/game.js#L64-L72)
  - Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.

    We did not deviate from the instructions here.
  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?

    Testing these collisions has been difficult since a canvas object must be defined within the test suite for the game file to run.


### GOAL 2
- [Link to commit with goal accomplished](https://github.com/nickpisciotta/game-time/blob/master/lib/obstacle.js#L4-L16)
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.

  We did not deviate here.  All pieces and background now have images.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?

  None at this time.


### GOAL 3
- Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.

  Scoring plan has been completed and some functional code exists. We also have code that is saving the player's lives into local storage.  The same will be done for the score.
- Questions, Comments, Concerns?

  None, really.  Just need to finalize this and display it on the page.
### GOAL 4

- Questions, Comments, Concerns?

  Haven't coded out level advancement just yet, but imagine it will check game state and depending on the level, the pieces will move proportionally (level 3 = 3x speed of obstacles)
## Next Steps?

- What do you feel the next steps should be?
- Increase test coverage
- Finalize scoring/local storage
- Add level state to game and increase the levels after a min score
  has been achieved.
- Add platforms in the upper half of the screen
- README
- Definitely need to continue refactoring

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
- How can we test the game functions without the canvas
- Best styling practices in JS
- Figuring out tricks to minimalize the requestAnimation
- Code organization

# Instructor Section

### Points for Second Check In (base 50)

* 60 points: Students documented their work well and completed all base goals or have documented where/why they deviated from the goal in a reasonable way. Students completed additional stretch goals.

* 35 points: Students completed all base goals but did not document the work appropriately in their form || did not complete 1 goal and failed to document why in a reasonable way.
* 25 points: Students did not complete more than 1 goal.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

These goals should center around wrapping up the game:

 - Matching the [rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown) requirements
 - Refactoring/Cleaning up test coverage
 - Making the game compelling for players
 - Making sure the README and other documentation is up to snuff
 - Making sure the game is deployed

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_
