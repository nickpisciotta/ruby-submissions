# Game Time Check In # 3

## Instructor Goal Completion (Complete 2 of 3)

### GOAL 1 - Continue working to nail down procedural generation

  ![Current Progress](http://i.imgur.com/QXKxLGo.png)
  - All required procedural generation is now complete.
  - The original algorithm (found [here](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/)) was modified due to issues with performance and stability. New form is just as flexible, though not as complex of an output design-wise.

### GOAL 2 -  Player Movement first start - ie a block that moves around and has some form of collision

  - Completed. Players can move using the arrow keys.
  - All movement is limited to walkable space (currently denoted as grey).

### GOAL 3 - Documenting your work and the code and talk about, in the README, what you've written so far

- Completed. [Found here](https://github.com/Riizu/sloc/blob/develop/README.md).

### Stretch Goal - Complete All Goals

- Completed! :thumbs-up:
- Also completed enemies and teleporters.

## Next Steps?

- Camera
- FoV (reveals rooms as they are discovered)
- Finish Win/Loss conditions for the whole game and the individual levels
- Add scoreboard
- Add per-game stats
- Add polish items (Tilesets, music)
- Refactor/Add any missing tests

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?

This check in's goals went far smoother than the last set. Since we went on the lax side, there was less stress and it was easier to focus on getting things done. In the end not only did we end up meeting all our stretch goals, we got extra done (though partially due to a lapse in memory resulting in thinking the check in was a day early) too.

At this point, we both feel very strong about finishing all of planned goals in time for turn in. Most of our timesink was early on with the procedural generation, but now that it works its been very easy to add more to it, which is why we were able to add two major features in an evening (major points to Parker on that one). Camera may eat up some time, but we feel confident we'll get it finished.

# Instructor Section

### Points for Second Check In (base 50)

* **60 points: Students documented their work well and completed all base goals or have documented where/why they deviated from the goal in a reasonable way. Students completed additional stretch goals.**
* 50 points: Students documented their work well and completed all base goals or have documented where/why they deviated from the goal in a reasonable way.
* 35 points: Students completed all base goals but did not document the work appropriately in their form || did not complete 1 goal and failed to document why in a reasonable way.
* 25 points: Students did not complete more than 1 goal.
* 0 points: Students did not complete check in form prior to eval.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

These goals should center around wrapping up the game:

 - Matching the [rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown) requirements
 - Refactoring/Cleaning up test coverage
 - Making the game compelling for players
 - Making sure the README and other documentation is up to snuff
 - Making sure the game is deployed

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

- Refactor/Add any missing tests

- Camera
- Finish Win/Loss conditions for the whole game and the individual levels
- Add scoreboard
- Add polish items (Tilesets, music)
- Enemy movement
- FoV (reveals rooms as they are discovered)
- Add per-game stats
