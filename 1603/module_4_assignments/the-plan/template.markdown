# Goals Assignment

## Goal #1: Become more proficient in JavaScript
### Current status:
  * I would consider myself to be at a beginner level. I have a vague idea of how to use JS in an Object-Oriented fashion, but certainly would like to work more with the class syntax.  I also need to get more familiar with ES2015, so that I'm not completely thrown off when I see a declarative function with a '=>'...

### Future Success:
  * Future success will come in the form of having multiple apps with heavy use of vanilla JS and some JS frameworks.  I would like to have built a few apps running on Node, and utilize some frameworks like Ember and Express.

### Potential Resources:
  * Code School seems to have a good tutorial on ES2015, which I find is a good place to start.  
  * Jon Duckett's "JavaScript and jQuery" book is also a great resource to cover the basics in JS.
  * Need to find more JS-centered meetups
    * Eventually I would like to be proficient enough to give a small lightning talk or speak at a beginner's track at a JS meetup.

### Importance:
  *   It's clear from multiple job postings I have come across that there is an expectation that most developers know JS well.  I recognize how quickly the JS community is growing and how many new tools are being developed.  I know I will benefit from a strong understanding of JS and some of its most utilized frameworks and libraries.

## Goal #2: Better at FE UI and UX  
### Current Status:
  *  All of my projects throughout Turing utilized Bootstrap as a FE framework.  I never attempted to design an app in using just HTML and CSS.  I know enough HTML and CSS to get by, but not content with how much I know.

### Future Success:
* I would like to take the time to learn more about all CSS is capable of, and design a static web page from the ground up using just CSS. React also seems to be very popular these days, and seeing that it is known for being a powerful tool, I hope to get better at this as well.

### Potential Resources:
* Read more of Jon Duckett's "HTML and CSS"
* Complete more tutorials on designing a page using just CSS
* React and UI/UX meetups

### Importance:
* I think to be considered a "Full-Stack" developer, I should be able to contribute extensively to the design and layout of a web page.  I would like to exercise more of my artistic/creative thinking and feel that the FE is the best way to do this.  I don't want CSS to be some enigma that I also delegate to someone else to do.

## Goal #3:  Good at SQL/ActiveRecord and Analyzing Large Datasets

### Current Status:
*  I can write some basic to intermediate queries in AR and SQL, but I would like to take the time to get better at writing advanced SQL statements and deeply understanding relational and NoSQL databases.

### Future Success:
* I need more practice working with large datasets.  Also, some familiarity with NoSQL databases would be nice to have as well.


### Potential Resources:
* Litany of SQL playgrounds to get experience writing queries
* NoSQL databases
* BigData meetups


### Importance:
*  With apps collecting more and more data from its users these days, the importance of aggregating and analyzing this data is becoming more and more important.  Aside from all the advanced statistical and mathematical techniques that can be used, I know that being proficient in complicated SQL and AR queries will be very beneficial when I begin working with more advance datasets.
