Notes:
* Base expectations complete plus 1 extension
* Solid testing suite with unit and integrations tests
* Intentional division of responsibilities between classes AND methods; demonstrates thoughtful design and sound implementation of that design
* Ruby style: some small issues that held project back from "demonstrates _excellent_ knowledge of" style, but overall relatively clean and stylistically consistent project. Nice job!
* Only had use for two enumerables, chosen appropriately. Project's execution doesn't lend itself to a 4 in this category. 
* Only bug: count continues to increment with duplicate words. Does not affect trie structure.
