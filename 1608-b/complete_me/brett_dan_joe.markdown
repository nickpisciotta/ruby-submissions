Notes:
* Completed base expectations and extension: Shoes
* TDD functional, focuses mostly on high-level tests that verify methods do-all-the-things. Opportunities exist to test supporting methods. Overall, solid. 
* Encapsulation: methods managing multiple levels of responsibility, need to extract execution of distinct tasks into concise, explicitly-named methods, opportunities to improve naming overall to aid readability
* Style often solid, but with some inconsistencies: double negatives (!= nil?) and "if nil?" instead of unless. Opportunities to create more clear parallelism in code.
* Execution of project didn't require many enumerables. Some sounds use, some missing opportunities to consolidate tasks (ex: sanitizing letters)

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
