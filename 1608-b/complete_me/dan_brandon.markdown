Notes: 
* Bug on select, otherwise addresses base expectations, no extensions
* More tests needed, to cover existing methods and supporting methods
* Breaking logic into components: need to go farther here
* Enumerables solid

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
