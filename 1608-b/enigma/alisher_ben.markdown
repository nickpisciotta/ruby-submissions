Notes:

* 37 tests all pass
* Tests are good and clear
* Look for opportunities to break out child objects when you see differing levels of abstraction
* Like the testing of crack
* Implementation looks good
* Complexity is broken up well

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
