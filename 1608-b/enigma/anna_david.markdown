Notes:
* Generally good testing, would like to see additional cases next time.
* Some methods are doing a bit too much and there is some repetition in code.
* Think about when you're using instance variables and you have methods that are just modifying the contents of an instance variable. Remember that you should be writing methods that generally take an argument and return a value - this will make testing a ton easier.
* Code is broken out well into appropriate classes.
* Start thinking about whether instantiated classes need to be instantiated, or if they can hold class methods.
* Look into the use of modules.
* project complete, used brute force crack approach

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
