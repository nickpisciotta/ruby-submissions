Notes:

* 24 tests with 4 failing
* lots of tiny code smells to work on simplifying
* watch out for the little things like mismatching names (off_set vs offset) and indentation
* in the end it looks like a good learning project
* try writing code then throwing it away

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
