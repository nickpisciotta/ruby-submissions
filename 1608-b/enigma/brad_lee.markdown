Notes:
* 19 tests, 27 assertions, 100% test coverage
* good separation of responsibilities
* encrypt & decrypt methods live in enigma, but its still a lean class
* couldve refactored out the duplicated code in encrypt/decrypt methods

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.


### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration


### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
