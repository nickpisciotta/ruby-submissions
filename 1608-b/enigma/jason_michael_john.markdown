Notes:
* test coverage is sparse
* separation of responsibilities is done well
* crack method was not complete
* did use 127 character alphabet using ascii map

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.


### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
