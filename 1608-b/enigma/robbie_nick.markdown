Notes:

* 28 tests all pass, one skip
* Tests are overall good growth, don't quite feel fluent/full, but good progress
* implementation is pretty good
* some over-use of instance variables
* a little bit of leaky abstraction when encapsulating functionality
* watch out for "code smells" that show you weakness

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
