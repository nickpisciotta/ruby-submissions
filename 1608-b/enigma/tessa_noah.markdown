Notes:
* Essentially no testing.
* Fully functional application including complete character map
* A bit overuse of instance variables, think about how we can send messages to and from methods as opposed ot having them modify instance variables.
* Good use of inheritance throughout project 
* some methods are doing too much, think about general cases.

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components


* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
